# Phishing Net

This is a set of Python classes for implementing both logistic regression and
a perceptron-based multi-layer neural network using backpropagation. These are
used to attempt to correctly classify data from the
[web page phishing detection](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c2gw7fy2j4/3)
dataset. This is my Supervised Learning project for the 2022 Spring semester
Machine Learning course for my MS program in Computer Science.
